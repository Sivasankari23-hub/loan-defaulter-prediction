# Loan Default Prediction

This project uses **machine learning** to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default.  
By analyzing factors like income, credit history, and employment status, the model helps financial institutions assess risk and make informed lending decisions.

##  Files in this Repo
- `loan_data.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `loan_default_prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook with data analysis, model building & evaluation.
- `requirements.txt` – All required Python libraries.

---

##  Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- SMOTE for class balancing
- Random Forest Classifier
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

## Accuracy & Results
The model was trained using a Random Forest algorithm and balanced using SMOTE.  
It achieved **~85–90% accuracy** depending on parameter tuning.
